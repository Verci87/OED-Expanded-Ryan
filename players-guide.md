## PLAYER’S RULES (V. 1.0.7.R)

#### RACES

**Humans** : Full XP gain ^2

**Dwarves** : -20% XP gain, resist magic +4, dodge giants +4, find stone traps +1.

**Elves** : -20% XP gain, hide in woods (4 in 6), find wood traps +1.

**Halflings** : Hide in woods (4 in 6), resist magic +4, ranged attacks +4.^3

#### CLASSES

**Fighters** : Use heavy armor, all weapons, fighter feats; attack bonus +1, hit points d8 per level (hp +3/level after name).

#### ALIGNMENT

**Three Alignments** : Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic. New characters should list either
Lawful or Neutral (if Chaotic, secretly inform the DM).^5

#### ABILITIES

**Random Abilities** : At first level, roll one selected ability 2d6+6, others 3d6 in
order. For starting hit dice, re-roll any results of “1” or “2”.^6

#### EQUIPMENT

**Starting Money** : Starting money (3d6×10) and equipment prices are in silver
pieces. Chain mail costs 50, plate 200; a silver dagger 30, potion of healing 200,
potion of mithridate 1000; rumors 10-60, ads for hires 100 sp each.^7

#### TARGET 20

**Core Mechanic** : For most combat actions, roll d20 + level + modifiers, with
success indicated on a total of 20 or more.^8


#### ABILITY MODIFIERS

**Values** : See table to the right for standard modifiers. The
sequence continues in each direction (1 point modifier for
every 3 ability score points). 9

|Score   |Modifier|
|--------|---|
|0-2     |-3 |
|3-5     |-2 |
|6-8     |-1 | 
|9-12    | 0 |
|13-15   |+1 |
|16-18   |+2 |
|19-21   |+3 |
|22-24   |+4 |
|Every 3 |(+1) |

**Effects** :

- *Strength*: Melee Attacks and Melee Damage
- *Intelligence*: Secret Door and Trap Detection
- *Wisdom*: Saves vs. Mental Attacks
- *Dexterity*: Missile Attacks and Armor Class
- *Constitution*: Hit Die Rolls
- *Charisma*: Reaction Rolls

#### FIGHTER FEATS

**Feats** : Fighters can select one feat every 4 levels (starting at 4th) to expand their combat abilities (see the section later for available feats). When fighting 1st level (1-hit-die) opponents in melee, fighters get one attack per level.^11

#### THIEF SKILLS

**Skills** : Thieves have the ability to (1) open locks, (2) remove traps, (3) pick
pockets, (4) move silently, and (5) hide in shadows. Success requires rolling d
+ level + Dex modifier, and scoring 20 or more (3 tries per target). Thieves add
+1 to hear noise and climb wall checks, and score double damage from a silent
attack from behind. These bonuses increment every 4 levels.^12

#### WIZARD SPELLS

**Spells** : Wizards start with a spellbook containing all 1st-level spells. Only one
instance of a given spell can be memorized at a time (no duplicates). Adding a
new spell from a book or scroll takes a roll of d20 + level + Int modifier, scoring
20 or more, and one day per spell level (3 tries per spell). Wizards may research
new spells at any level, craft potions & scrolls at 4th, wands & weapons at 8th, and
any other magic items at 12th level. See book for costs.^13

#### MOVE RATES

**Scale** : One turn is 1 minute. One round is 6 seconds. One inch is 5 feet (also
called one “pace”).^14

**Encumbrance** : Gear carried is measured in stone weight. See table to the right for values.^15

**Movement** : Characters can carry stone weight of up to 1/3 their Strength score at full move rate; up to 2/3 at 2/3 move rate; and up to full Strength at half move rate.^16

| Items | Weight |
| --- | --- |
|Light weapon, helmet, bow, arrows, rope, skins, spikes, torches, lantern | 1/3 |
|Medium or heavy weapon, leather, shield, staff, pole, rations, 1K coins | 1 |
|Chain mail| 2 |
|Plate mail| 4 |

#### WEAPONS

See the matrix below for melee weapon damage and special effects.^17


| Type | Light | Medium | Heavy |
|---|---|---|---|
|Sword |Dagger (1d4)| Sword (1d8)| 2-H Sword (1d10)|
|Spear |Spear (1d6) |Polearm (1d8) |Lance/Pike (1d8) *|
|Axe |Hand Axe (1d6) |Battle Axe (1d8) |Halberd (1d10)|
|Club| Mace (1d6) |Morning Star (1d8) |Flail (1d8) **|

**Types** : Swords can be drawn and used in a single round. Spears can be used to
attack from a second rank. Axes get +2 to hit targets in medium or heavy armor.
Clubs get +4 to hit heavy armor.^18

**Length**: The longer your weapon, the higher in initiative order you attack. Spears go before swords, swords go before axes, axes go before daggers.

**Sizes** : Light weapons are one-handed, and can be thrown up to 60 feet (12”).
Medium weapons are one-handed for man-sized creatures (except polearms).
Heavy weapons and polearms are two-handed for men.^19

**Specials** : (*) Lances do double damage when used from a charging mount;
pikes get double damage when set against such a charge. (**) Flails ignore any
opponent shield bonuses.^20

**Missile Weapons** : Bows and slings fire every round; crossbows every other
round. Attack rolls are –1 per 10 feet range. Damage is 1d6 for arrows and
quarrels, 1d4 for sling stones.^21

**Race/Class Restrictions** : Halflings can use only light or medium (two-handed)
melee weapons, slings, shortbows, and light crossbows. Thieves are skilled in
light melee weapons, normal swords, slings, and light crossbows.^22

#### COMBAT

**Surprise** : A roll of 2 in 6 normally indicates surprise. Unseen parties (hidden,
invisible, elven cloak) add +2. Silenced parties (motionless, undead, move
silently) add +2. Warning (e.g., light, noise, magic detection) foils surprise.^23

**Initiative** : Creatures act simultaneously. Each side declares actions and the DM resolves. Combat goes in phases; move, shoot, magic, melee. Figures must stand still to cast spells, fire missiles, or set pikes.^24

**Descending AC Attacks** : Attacks are made by rolling d20 + attack bonus + AC of target and scoring 20 or more. Monsters use their hit dice for attack bonus.

**Ascending AC Attacks** : Attacks are made by rolling d20 + attack bonus and scoring equal to or higher than the targets AC.

**Saves** : Saving throws are made by rolling d20 + level +
modifiers (see table) and scoring 20 or more.^25


|Type   | Modifier |
|---    |---       |
|Spells | 0 |
|Breath |+1 |
|Stone  |+2 |
|Wands  |+3 |
|Death  |+4 |


#### FIGHTER FEATS

1. **Berserking** : Rage to gain +4 levels (hits, saves, and hit dice) for one
    melee; afterward, save vs. breath or lose ability for the day.^26
2. **Exceptional Strength** : Add + 3 to your Strength ability.
3. **Great Fortitude** : Gain a +4 bonus to saves against poison, disease,
    and death.
4. **Iron Will** : Gain a +4 bonus to saves against mental attacks, including
    charm, fear, and illusions.
5. **Mounted Combat** : Gain +2 to hit and +4 damage with mounted lance
    attacks, and +4 to saves against being unhorsed.
6. **Rapid Shot** : Gain an extra attack every round in missile combat.
7. **Rapid Strike** : Gain an attack on alternate rounds in melee combat.^27
8. **Survival** : Gain a +2 bonus to checks to find food, water, shelter, or
    avoid being lost in the wilderness.
9. **Toughness** : Add an extra +2 hit points per level.
10. **Tracking** : Track prey on a 4-in-6 chance basis, adjusted for small or
    large parties, inclement weather, and the like.
11. **Scout** : Gain +1 to surprise enemies and +1 to avoid being surprised
12. **Weapon Specialization** : Gain +2 to hit and damage with one weapon
    of choice.
13. **Sweep Attacks** : Can melee attack a number of 1 HD opponents equal to their level in one round.

#### MULTI-CLASSING

**Adding Classes** : To add a new class, a character needs a score of 16 or more in
the new prime requisite, and must sacrifice F2000XP, T1200XP, W2500XP.^29

**Experience** : After each adventure, the character applies all earned XP to a
single class of their choice. Elves and Dwarves gain -20%. ^30

**Benefits** : The multi-classed character uses the best entry for armor, weapons,
attacks, and saves. Hit points are rolled for each class, with the highest being
used. Fighter/wizards may cast spells in leather or chain (melee weapon in one
hand, no shield). Some Thief skills are restricted to leather armor only.^31

#### NOTES AND REFERENCES

This document has been modified by Ryan for his OEDr game.

1. This document is available for free at [http://www.oedgames.com.](http://www.oedgames.com.) These endnotes
    are intended for (a) DMs who want to check on reasoning, justifications, and
    history of the game, and (b) the author himself, so he doesn’t keep redoing
    the same research repeatedly. The document is designed to allow printing
    only pages 1-4 for players at the table; that is, using a single letter-sized
    sheet of paper, and without endnotes. For various citations of the associated
    blog, visit deltasdnd.blogspot.com.
2. By default, racial level limits for nonhumans in the core OD&D books apply
    (see OD&D Vol-1, p. 7-8). In the fighter class, dwarves are limited to 6th level,
    elves and halflings 4th. Elves can be wizards to a maximum level of 8th (and
    this DM allows dwarf & halfling wizards to 4th level max). Thieves are
    unlimited in level for any race (Sup-I, p. 4). The present author thinks these
    limits are useful for world-building purposes; but he often places special
    items or magics that allow PCs to exceed them. Many DMs, of course, waive
    them completely.
3. Traps here include secret doors, compartments, etc., of the appropriate
    material. Dwarf +4 dodge bonus is as per AD&D (PHB, p. 16), and
    statistically more in line with the Chainmail half-hits ability (CM p. 29) than
    lower values. Halfling ranged modifier echoes the bonus of +3 seen in Sup-I
    (Errata) and AD&D (MM, p. 50), here rounded to +4 to match other combat
    bonuses. (Tolkien refers to hobbits as “keen-eyed and sure at the mark”; see
    blog 2018-01-01.) See also OD&D Discussion. Infravision is noted starting
    with _Chainmail_ p. 43 (Fantasy Reference Table).
4. Optionally, the DM may allow wizards to start with a staff (assume: two-
    handed, 1d6 damage, no special modifiers). They are allowed use of the
    _staff of striking_ and related items in OD&D Vol-2 (p. 25 & 35). Since they’re
    not in the basic equipment list, we don’t further mention them here.
5. New players may need clarification on alignments. In short: Law is peace,
    Chaos is war. Lawful PCs want to expand civilization; Chaotic types want it
    broken down; Neutral seek a balance, or only self-interest. See works of
    Anderson ( _Three Hearts and Three Lions_ ) and Moorcock; blog 2011-02-
    and 2014-10-23. Note that creatures hearing an opposing alignment
    language will attack (Vol-1, p. 12). Gygax in _The Strategic Review_ (TSR) #6,
    re: law/chaos vs. good/evil, says, “When that was written they meant just
    about the same thing in my mind” (as Anderson, Ch. 12); in _Dragon_ #9 he
    notes the possibility of reporting a fake alignment. Arneson, FFC p. 52: Good
    guys take prisoners, pay taxes, obey the king; bad guys give all loot to
    leader, never take prisoners, stab each other in the back.
6. These boosts reflect the natural-selection effect observed for those surviving
    0-level. See blog posts 2014-08-07 and 2015-05-04.
7. Compare the copper, silver, gold pieces to English pence, groats, and nobles
    (respectively ⅓s and ⅓L). Note that pounds and shillings were never
    medieval coins (see blog 2010-03-30, 2010-05-19). Statistical analysis


```
suggests that D&D gp has purchasing power of about a half-shilling (see
blog 2019-06-03). Following groat value, we take historical shilling values
and multiply by 3 for our sp standard (e.g., done for armor here). For silver
weapons history, see blog 2016-01-25. Costs for ads & rumors are from Vol-
3, p. 23. Potion prices are roughly the base prices in both OD&D and AD&D,
assuming alchemist help to reduce the cost (see blog 2020-08-17).
```
8. For more information on the Target 20 mechanical system, visit the website
    at: [http://www.oedgames.com/target20.](http://www.oedgames.com/target20.)
9. The 3d6 distribution has a standard deviation of about 3 (2.96), so modifiers
    indicate statistical z-score (number of standard deviations from the mean).

10.We _don’t_ give earned-experience modifiers for extreme ability scores.

11.The concept of “feats” is intended as a wrapper for various fighter-boosts
seen in early editions of D&D, including various subclass options. Compare
to the status boosts in _Chainmail_ for Heroes and Superheroes (4th, 8th level;
used in Arneson-circle games, and documented in Dan Boggs’ ZED rules);
and also to 3E D&D Feats (ours tend to a value of 2 such feats together).
The many-attacks rule is the “normal” mode against regular opponents, as
expressed in Chainmail (p. 30), the D&D FAQ in TSR #2 (p. 3), Swords &
Spells (p. 1), and the AD&D PHB (p. 25). Later editions have similar options
variously called “sweep” or “cleave” attacks, etc. (see blog 2021-05-24,
2021-05-31, and 2021-11-29). It’s a key balancing factor against the many
one-hit-die monsters that number in the hundreds as per standard lists in
O/AD&D (blog 2021-12-06). The DM may opt to apply a single attack and
damage roll against all the opponents in one round, or some other ruling.
More detail on running large-scale battles is given in _OED Book of War._
DMs running B/X or BECMI-style games may wish to ignore the sweep-
attack ability; however, monster numbers appearing should be greatly
reduced for 1st-level types, as compared to O/AD&D. (Arguably this would
also balance humanoids vs. other monster groups.)

12.Per Sup-I, "remove traps" deals only with small devices (poison needles,
etc.). No special reading abilities are included here. Thief skills should not
trigger traps, etc., except possibly on a natural 1 (DM’s option). Achieving
silent backstab position takes a full round before the attack. Compare the 3
tries rule to listening for noises in AD&D (DMG p. 60).

13.Reasons for no duplication of spells: (1) More like stories of Jack Vance
( _Dying Earth_ ), (2) more balanced (no squatting on an overpowered spell), (3)
more interesting variety of effects in-game, (4) easier bookkeeping (by cards
or checklist). Note that in Gygax modules usually only a few cleric spells
( _cures_ ) are duplicated in practice. Compare to a dramatic treatment where
any power/trick usually gets used only once per episode.
Checks for adding spells from a scroll are harder than in AD&D (PHB p. 10),
but can be retried; the one day/level is per DMG p. 117. Use the same check
for researching new spells, at +4 per cost increment (this matches the
chances in Vol-1, p. 34 at 1st level). We considered a penalty for increasing


```
spell level (as per DMG p. 119), but found it too restrictive. Costs assume no
special resources; if a library is available, then reduce cost by half.
In O/AD&D, scrolls & wands have a default caster level of 6th, staffs 8th (see
OD&D Vol-2, p. 32, 34; AD&D DMG p. 128, 133, 135), so arguably we could
use these as the revised levels for crafting. In light of our further-simplified
rule, we revise the default scroll level to 4th.
```
14.The time scale matches original _Chainmail_ turns of 1 minute, with a shorter
round increment for melee (e.g., _Chainmail_ Fatigue rules); see blog 2012-07-

09. The 1” = 5 feet scale (a) matches the 30mm figure scale, (b) matches the
1/6 time scale adjustment, and (c) makes the _Chainmail_ man-to-man missile-
fire chances reasonable (not so at larger scale); see blog 2018-08-27.
Compare to other TSR/Gygax games in the same year as OD&D, _Warriors
of Mars_ and _Boot Hill_ , which have 1 turn = 10 seconds, 1” = 6 feet scales.
Rounds are also 10 seconds in Holmes Basic (p. 20); Moldvay Basic
suggests 1” = 5 feet table scale (p. B61). The “pace” here is the Roman
pace. There is no change in units for man-to-man action indoors-vs-
outdoors; see blog 2018-08-20.

15.For the benefits of stone units for encumbrance, see blog (2007-04-15,
2010-09-29). The DM may wish to audit PC encumbrance post-game.

16.The base combat speed is equivalent to a jog (4 mph = 6 ft/sec); walking
would be half speed, running double. No bonus for “charge” movement.

17.Damage parameters are basically the same as in the Sup-I variant (counting
Man-sized only), or Moldvay Basic. See blog 2009-02-24, 2014-04-08.

18.Weapon details are inspired by rules in _Chainmail,_ Supplement-I, and TSR
#1-2. We assume non-swords take a round to draw & ready. Spear
advantage is traditionally first attack; we find that awkward at the D&D table,
and so replace it with back-rank access, but the DM may wish to grant a first
attack otherwise; also, we relax the prohibition on pole arms/pikes in
dungeons (say, 6’/10’ max length; contrast with Sup-I, p. 15). Gygax supports
this in _Dragon_ #24 (“The center rank characters will also be able to engage
in hand-to-hand combat if they have equipped themselves with spears or
thrusting pole arms which are of size useful in the surroundings.”). Axe &
club modifiers vs. armor in CM/Sup-I tend to be on the order of +1/+2, which
we double for the CM-to-D&D conversion. We apply these bonuses vs.
animals or beasts with tough hide (AC 5 or better; see DMG p. 28, “horny or
bony armor might be classed as plate mail...“), but not extradimensional, fey,
or undead monsters. Simple wooden weapons (e.g., like a staff or a
monster’s crude club) should _not_ get these bonuses. The halberd represents
any two-handed poleaxe-type weapon (bardiche, lochaber axe, etc.; TSR #2,
p. 6). A hammer or military pick is equivalent to a mace (Sup-I, p. 15).

19.In _Chainmail_ (p. 10) throwing ranges for axes and spears were given as 3” =
90 ft, javelins 6” = 180 ft. In Vol-2 (p. 31) ranges were given the same 3”, i.e.,
only 30 feet indoors. Modern axe-throwing target competitions are held at 15,
20, or 30 feet; Olympic distance records for shot put around 60 ft, javelin 270


```
ft (Wikipedia). We use 60 ft here as the maximum (reasonable with 10 foot
ceiling, per author calculation). See also Milks, et. al.
```
20. _Chainmail_ gives charging horses a bonus of 1 die per figure (see p. 17,
    “impetus”). Spears get double damage vs. charge in Vol-2 (p. 31) and Sup-I
    (p. 15). AD&D PHB gives double damage to lances & spears (p. 37). Cook
    Expert gives double damage to lances. Set pikes should interrupt a charge
    against them; Ffoulkes, _Armour & Weapons_ , notes pikes would have a
    special spike in the end to stick in the ground and resist cavalry (Ch. 7). The
    flail effect is taken from Wikipedia.

21.Rates of fire are interpolated from mass _Chainmail_ , where bows fire 2/turn,
light crossbows 1/turn, and heavy crossbows ½/turn (when standing).
Ranges and accuracy dropoff are calibrated from real-world data, physical
modeling, and computer simulation (see blog articles 2010-08-30, 2011-03-
07, 2014-04-14, 2015-02-16, 2018-08-06, 2018-08-13, 2019-02-04; simulator
on GitHub). The modifier of –1 per 10 feet is taken as the simplest possible
approximation, in the area of most interest, to what should be a logistic
function; alternatively, one might consider no modifier to 30’, but then –1 per
5 feet beyond that (blog 2019-03-14). The rule here handles targeting at an
individual; for firing at larger groups and longer distances, see the Judges’
Rules. In theory, we could also give armor bonuses vs. missiles for leather
(blog 2011-05-06), or large shields (say +2; see DMG p. 28, or SCA archery
materials; but rejected after BOW playtests). Slings are considered very
effective with training (as per Gygax in TSR #7; see also blog 2017-05-19).

22.For sizing, see AD&D PHB notes (p. 19) and also 3E size rules. Thief
weapons vary greatly by edition (see blog 2017-06-12).

23.Parties with light never surprise monsters except via a door (Vol-3, p. 9).
Auto-initiative seems implied in Vol-3, p. 10 (wyvern example), but this is
counter-indicated by examples in TSR #2 (p. 3), B/X, AD&D, etc. Undead are
always silent (Vol-3, p. 9; Sup-II, p. 1).

24.OD&D has no book rule for initiative. Chainmail had opposed d6’s but then
intermingled phases (p. 9); TSR #2 seems to have the first round-by-round
d6 team initiative that we know of (FAQ, p. 3, modified by Dexterity). Around-
the-table turn sequence is asserted by Gygax (in context of ~20 players at
table; ENWorld Q&A 2005-02-14). Move restrictions are similar to those in
_Chainmail_ and _Swords & Spells_. Joshua Macy points out that if initiative was
randomized every turn, one would need a phased turn structure to model
simultaneous time (see blog 2021-01-29). The DM may permit throwing
weapons in the same direction as a forward move. We do not give a free
attack against one disengaging from melee (see blog 2018-08-23).

25.This mechanic for saves is somewhat harsher at the lowest levels, and more
generous at the highest levels, than Vol-1. Wizards/thieves should get –2 to
breath, wands, and death, but this was always dropped in play. See blog
2009-09-03 for charts and analysis regarding the saving throw tables in Vol-

1. See OD&D Discussion for various interpretations of the save categories.


26.The added hit points may either be rolled each time, or taken as an average
(say: 20 points), at the DM’s option. Damage in the melee is first subtracted
from these temporary hit points. Compare to berserkers in Vol-2 (p. 6),
followers of Odin and Tyr in Sup-IV (p. 22, 24), the berserker class in _Dragon_
#3 (p. 27), and the 3E Barbarian. In AD&D, berserking is most often
presented as a curse, causing random attacks, including against friends –
e.g., see the _ring of berserk strength_ , _scarab of enraging enemies_ , _cursed
berserking sword_ , and artifact power IV-V. However, in the interest of bands
of berserkers fighting together, we don’t emulate that here. Also see blog
comments 2017-09-05.

27.The author is aware that many seem to hate this mechanic. That said, it’s
balanced with the other offensive feats; compare to AD&D, where the first
bump for fighter attacks is given at a rate of 3/2 rounds (PHB p. 25; starting
at 7th level). Options for handling the alternating rounds: use a chip or card
marker; roll a d6 and allow a 2nd attack on a result of 1-3; or allow a 2nd attack
when the first attack die is even.

28.Parrying is in _Chainmail_ (p. 25-26); note the value is more than a shield.

29.The 1,000 XP matches the zero-level increment (see Judge’s Book). Paul S.
reports players taking 2nd class early and leaving it at 0 XP; but not enforcing
the 16 ability requirement (from Vol-1, p. 10).

30.This is our take on the classic “freely switch class... but not during the course
of a single game” rule (Vol-1, p. 8). It’s a fairly common interpretation among
OD&D players (see OD&D Discussion).

31.Consider the many examples of Gygaxian elven fighter/wizards in chain but
not plate; e.g., throughout the GDQ modules, and also encounters in the
_World of Greyhawk_ (1983 boxed set Glossography p. 4). AD&D 2E gave a
rule for multiclass wizards to cast only in elven chain; an online poll showed
that a majority of AD&D 1E DMs follow this same rule (see blog 2019-07-21).
The D&D _Monster & Treasure Assortment_ shows elves mostly at AC 5
(chain), with a half-dozen higher-level types at AC 2 (plate).
