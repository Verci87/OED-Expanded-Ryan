# Equipment

## Money

**Starting Money**: 3d6x10 **Silver** Pieces (SP).

**Silver Standard**: OED uses a Silver standard for money. A Silver
Piece in OED has the buying power of a GP in traditional sources. In
published sources replace references to "gold pieces' with"silver
pieces", keeping original amount. Silver becomes Copper, Platinum
becomes Gold and so on.

**Calculating Costs**: For items not listed, take the historical value
in shillings and multiply by 3 for SP cost.

**Monthly Upkeep**: Equal to 1% of current XP (of highest class) in
Silver Pieces, minimum 20 sp. Paid monthly. If unpaid, the character
suffers –10% to Attack rolls and HP, cumulative per month.

## Encumbrance

OED measures the encumbrance value of items in "Stone", roughly
equivalent to the historical unit. Characters can carry a number of
stone equal to their Strength. A character's encumbrance affects their
movement rate as shown below. This encumbrance level also functions as a
modifier to some rolls (see Adventuring Tasks).
  
|Level|Stone Carried|Effect|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Level 0|Up to 1/3 Strength Score|Full Movement Rate: 12" (60')|
|Level 1|Up to 2/3 Strength Score|Movement Reduced 1/3: 9" (45')|
|Level 2|Up to Strength Score|Movement Reduced 1/2 :6" (30')|
|Level 3|Up to 1.5x Strength Score|Movement Reduced to 0|

## Weapons

Weapons in OED fall into 3 categories, Light, Medium, and Heavy.  

Weapons have 5 main properties.

- **Sword**: Can be drawn and used in a single round.
- **Spear**: Can be used to attack from the 2^nd^ rank (+5') reach)
- **Axe**: +2 to hit targets in Medium/Heavy armor, or creatures with a
tough hide (AC 5 or better)
- **Club**: +4 to hit targets in Heavy armor, or creatures with a very
tough hide (AC 3 or better)
- **Ranged/Thrown**: -1 to Hit per 10', See also Firing at a Crowd below.
