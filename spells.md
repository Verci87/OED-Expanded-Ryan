can originate from the image instead of from the caster. Attacks do not affect it.

Reincarnate: (Range: Touch, Duration: Instant) This spell brings back a creature dead
for up to 1 week in another body. If the creature makes a save vs. death, then the soul

class and mental abilities are retained). If the type is not usually playable, then a save
vs. spells is required to avoid taking the personality (i.e., become a DM-run NPC).
