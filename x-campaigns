# Appendix B: Campaign Material

The below is not parrt of OED but is intended as starter guidelines to create an initial dungeon, settlement, and wilderness.  The best place to start is with your dungeon, this is where the majority of your play time is likely to be spent, and may be all you really need. 

## Design a Dungeon

When designing a dungeon from scratch, it should consist of several levels.  Each level should have access from above and below, and be made of interlocking corridors, passages, and secret doors.

We will start by designing one of these levels/areas.  A starting dungeon area should have 3-18 rooms of varying sizes.  Ultimately, the limit is the size of your graph paper or canvas.

    • Take your paper and sketch out a number of rooms across the surface.  These rooms can be standard rectangular constructed rooms, irregular shaped natural caves and tunnels, or a mix. 
    • Next, designate a room to be the main entrance to this area.  
    • Mark another area to be an exit to different level or area.
    • In addition to the main entrance and exit, an area should have an additional entrance/exit about every 6 rooms. There is a 50/50 chance that such a point of egress is hidden or a secret door.
    • Now, connect your rooms with hallways.  Keep in mind they aren’t simply connected all in a line.  For every 10 rooms or so consider adding an additional crossover between rooms that are not yet connected.  Again, there is a 50/50 chance that such a connection is concealed.
    • Place doors in rooms and between majors spaces. On a d6: 1-3 is a normal door; 4 is a Concealed Door; 5 is a Locked Door; 6 is a Trick Door (one way, portcullis, false door, etc.)
    • Consider adding: changes in elevation, water, and/or a rift or barrier to rooms or halls.
    • Leave yourself a space to hide a secret exit to even deeper levels should you want to expand this dungeon further.

At this point, you may wish to take your sketch and clean it up/redraw it.  For tips on map drawing, check out: https://dysonlogos.blog/maps/tutorials-help/.  But you don’t need to, your map does not need to be an artist rendering, it can look like a basic flow or org chart with squares to represent rooms and lines for hallways, with descriptive text conveying the size and layout.

With your map finalized; each room and location should be given a number designation that you can reference when you create your map key.  This key will list the contents of the room; be it treasure, traps, monsters, etc. as well as notes about important details.

Consider having 3 such levels or areas completed before play.  When combining levels consider:
    • Lower levels may connect directly outside via concealed passages or guarded entrances
    • A level may go down to two different unconnected levels (possibly to reconnect further down)
    • A level may go down to a much lower level, skipping a number of levels in between


## Populate the Dungeon
We will now add features to our map.  Follow the steps below, and mark the features down alongside your map, keyed to the given room (see template below)

Step 1: Place one or two treasures in rooms on the first few levels on the dungeon, examples include:
    • One moderate magic item such as a Sword +1 or Boots of Elven Kind
    • A chest of 1000 silvers pieces and pair of 500 sp gems.
    • A cache of Jewels and Artwork valued at 2000 silver.
We will use rumors of these items later when generating our settlement as a call to adventure.

Step 2: For each room on the map, roll a d6 with a 1 indicating that a trap is present.  Generate the trap using the guidelines above (see Traps )

Step 3: For rooms without a trap, roll a d6 with a 1 or 2 indicating there are monsters present.  Generate monsters appropriate for the intended level of the dungeon area. (see Monsters)
Monsters can be randomly selected from those of the appropriate threat level, or selected by the Judge to match the theme of the area or previous monster types.  

Step 4: Any room with a monster has a 3 in 6 chance for a treasure.  Generate a treasure appropriate to the intended level of the dungeon area (see Rewards).

Step 5: For any room without a monster, there is a 1 in 6 chance that a (hidden) treasure is present.  Again, generate a treasure appropriate to the intended level of the dungeon area (see Rewards)

Step 6: Create a list of 6 possible random encounters. Options 1-4 should match the creatures found in nearby rooms.  Entries 5-6 should be special: A leader, an NPC, an entirely different monster type, etc.

Updating the Dungeon: When an area of the dungeon is cleared of threats, there is a 1 in 6 chance per day that a group of 1HD creatures or other scavengers will fill the void.  Once a “season” the Judge should re-populate the vacated areas with appropriate strength monsters as for a new dungeon.

Adding Details
Now that you have a collection of rooms and their adventuring contents, it is time to flesh out the room descriptions.  The room contents (traps, treasure, monsters) serve as a starting point.  In general, a lair is going to have at least a rest area and a waste area.  For intelligent inhabitants, consider some of the below uses for the rooms.
	
	Galley/Kitchen		Living Quarters			Store Rooms	Guard Posts
	Prisoner Area		Area of Worship/Tribute	Boss Room	Treasure Room

Once you know what is in a room and decided what the room’s purpose is in the game world; consider what sort of mundane items may be in the room (furniture, containers, junk, decorative elements).  
For rooms with doors, which ones can lock?  How sturdy are they?  Take a moment to think about the sites, smells, and sounds present in each room; what can be perceived from down the hall or through the door that could influence the players’ decision-making?





Final Pass
With all that done, take a moment to mentally walk through your dungeon; both as a would-be adventurer and as one of the occupants.  Does the placement of traps, hazards, etc. make sense?  Can wandering monsters move about?  Do you like the layout of the rooms, hallways, entrances, exits, etc.?
If not, move things around.  You don’t have to wait to the end to change anything.  If a result comes up and you don’t care for it, do something else.

Design a Settlement
A settlement is a good second campaign item to work on.  This first settlement is where your characters will buy supplies, rest, and collect rumors and hirelings.  The first thing to determine when creating a settlement from scratch is its size.  This will help define the population and features. For your initial settlement, it is recommended to start with a Village.  Otherwise, you can select the size or determine it randomly with a 2d6 roll.

Hamlet: Small groupings of buildings consisting of mostly interrelated families. They are typically centered around one economic activity.  It is unlikely to have any stone structures.
Village: Larger and more spread out, usually with at least one central stone building such as a temple or fortification.  They will often have a formally recognized authority figure.
Town: These larger communities still cluster around a single central market or “downtown”.  In addition to leaders, they will have a small-dedicated watch or garrison.
City: A city will have multiple civic centers, often separated by district and purpose (residential, commercial, etc.).   They will almost always have walls, at least around their core.  The values listed here are for the city proper; they are often surrounded by outlying villages and communities of their own.
Capital: Much like a city, but larger, and likely the center of power (political or mercantile) for a region. 

Max Pop: This is the maximum number of people found in the community proper.  You can presume that 20% of this number are in a condition to take up arms as zero level NPCs when needed.
Market Cap: Items below this price can be readily found for sale in the community.  Above this level assume there is a base 10% chance and/or 1d6 weeks to procure. 
# of Hirelings: This is the number of available hirelings per season in the area. 
NPC level: This is the highest level of NPCs one is likely to encounter.  Folks above this level may be present, but they are special individuals, like adventurers or authority figures for example.
Sphere of Influence:  How much of the surrounding land the settlement able to keep peaceful and under control.  The populations of these areas are generally safe from monster and attacks. 

Populate the Settlement
While a settlement is composed of hundreds or thousands of individuals; in practice, you just need to focus on folks the PCs are likely to interact with.  You can create and develop others in response to play.
    • Who is in charge (an elder, mayor, council, lord, hierophant, etc.)
    • Where do they buy weapons/armor (a simple blacksmith, a dedicated weapon smith, a dwarf)
    • Where do they get common goods and supplies (at the inn, dedicated provisioner, open market)
    • Where do they carouse/hear rumors (tavern or taverns, inn, a local brewer, gambling hall)
    • Where do they rest (at the tavern, a separate inn, boarding house, unoccupied home)
    • Is there anyone in town who can help identify magic items, brew potions, or provide scrolls

Map Out the Settlement
You will want at least a basic map of the settlement for your and the players’ reference.  Again, this does not need to be an artistic endeavor.  It is enough to mark some lines for major roads in and through the settlement, location of the civic center, and the establishments you defined above.  You will also want to sketch in any bodies of water or other geographic features such as woods, hills, etc.  Finally, make a mark or notes on anything of interest on the outskirts; groves, abandoned structures, notable beings.
For Cities and Capitals, it is often enough to know the main roads, gates, major locations and buildings (such as the ruler’s keep, major temple, markets, etc.) as well as a rough idea of the “districts”.  

Details
With the basics of the settlement established, it is a good time to generate a collection of Hirelings and Rumors.  You may also stat up any town guard and proprietors of the major establishments your PC’s are likely to interact with, using the guidelines below.
Hirelings will be first level. Town guard (if present) are 1st level fighters with a 4th level sergeant for every 30 guards.  Most other townsfolk and specialists will be zero level.

Race: 1-3 (Human), 4 (Halfling), 5 (Dwarf), 6 (Elf)
	Class: 1-3 (Fighter), 4-5 (Thief), 6 (Wizard – roll again if Elf)
	Alignment: 1 (Lawful), 3-5 (Neutral), 6 (Chaotic-Hidden)
	Ability Scores: 3d6 in order if Zero level and +2 to one score of choice (max 18), if 1st level.
	Hit Points: By class, or 1d6 if Zero level. Reroll any 1s and 2s if first level.

You can even make a notable NPC or two (rulers, crazed hermits, etc.) of higher level (see NPCs above).  

Rumors
You can make up rumors based on the work you have done already, or randomly create some: 
Veracity: 1-2 = True, 3-4 = Mostly True, 5-6 = Mostly False
	When starting out, it is probably best to keep your rumors true.

Topic: 1-3 = Dungeon Location, 4-5 = Wilderness Location, 6 = Rules Lore
Dungeon Location: The first few of these should be related to the treasure you placed in the main dungeon and stories about the monsters within.  Afterward you can randomly determine the dungeon level and expand the topics. 

Wilderness/Other Location: Choose a detail about a neighboring settlement, forest, lair, or hex (if you have one).  This can be a further call to action, hints about wandering monsters, local politics, etc.

Rules Lore: This is a chance to introduce some aspects of play that may not be obvious to the players.  “The Witch at the edge of the wood can brew you a potion if you bring her a sample”, “Consuming Belladonna will prevent the curse of becoming a wolf”, etc. 

Finishing up
Finally, sprinkle in some details about the settlement like you did for the dungeon.  What are the sights and sounds one is greeted by.  How do they make their living? What do the locals think of Dwarves or Wizards?  Does the community harbor any secrets?

Notes
Design the Wilderness
Now that you have an adventuring location and a home base, it is time to fill in the areas around them.  
The first step is to draw out the wilderness; this is done on a series of 6 miles wide hexagons.  Hexagons are a useful way to abstract terrain and measure distances, by having a uniform distance between center points.  Specifically a 6-mile hex is advantageous because it has a 7-mile “diagonal”, and 3 mile “radius” which equates to the sight-line distance for a human sized character to the horizon in an open field.  Finally, it serves to break the traveling day into manageable segments.

To begin laying out your wilderness, start with a “Plains” hex, “P”, in the center of your space (marked with a 0 in the image.)  Working your way around, using the center hex as your reference terrain, roll 2d6 on the table below.  The result will be the terrain type of the new hex.  When generating additional terrain, always work out from the existing terrain type in the “middle” of the new area.  This will create natural “clumps” of terrain like forests.

2d6

Plains “P” 
3
Hills “H” 

10-11
Trees “T”
4-7
Same as Reference Hex 

12
Wetlands “W” (+1 to next roll) 

Remember, this is only the main type of terrain in the hex, a plains hex will have small wooded areas, a dry hex will have small ponds, a forested hex can also be hilly or have a bog, etc.

You may notice that mountains and water (lakes, oceans) are not included on this list.  Those are treated as hard boundaries and should be placed intentionally by the Judge.  (Keep in mind, mountain peaks can be seen from up to 120 miles/20 hexes away).  The Judge may also choose to adjust the terrain descriptions based on the climate (a forest becomes a jungle, plains becomes tundra, etc.)

In the very beginning, you only need a hex to put your settlement in, one for your dungeon, and enough to surround them both.  Over time, you can generate more terrain, enough to cover a few “day trips” from their base of operations (about a 6 hex radius).  
Depending on the size of the wilderness you create, you may wish to number the hexes.

The final steps are to place your starting settlement in the original plains hex, and then place your starting dungeon in an adjacent or nearby hex.  That is enough to get started.  When you are ready, you can populate the other hexes with content.

The World Beyond
It would take tremendous work to define an entire region or continent via Hex generation.  As you move beyond your starting region, it is recommended that you instead sketch out the major geographical features at that larger scale (mountain ranges, coasts, deserts, etc.) and zoom back in with hexes on any area in which play settles.  



Populate the Surrounding Hexes
Now that you have your starting terrain, a settlement, and a dungeon, it is time to place major features in the remaining hexes. The below simulates a borderlands of civilization where adventure happens.

There is a 1 in 20 chance that a hex has a major occupant, with the type determined on a d6 below:
	1-3: Major Dungeon (Multiple levels and areas as described above)
	4-5: Large Settlement (Town or larger as described above)
	6:     Stronghold (See below)

Remember, at this scale we are mainly concerned with showing major features.  These hexes can be riddled with villages, caves, ruins, monster lairs, bandit camps, etc. The Judge should feel free to drop in 2 other small settlements nearby and more features (such as additional dungeons) as needed.  

Additional Features
Barriers: In a given hex, there is a 10% chance of a ravine, river, or other moderate barrier.
Hills and Peaks: If a Hill hex is likewise surrounded by other Hill hexes, consider making the middle hex a (lonely) Mountain hex or prominent peak.
Mountains: In Mountain hexes, there is a 10% chance for a pass, and 1% chance for a volcano.
Rivers: Only the largest of rivers would be visible at this scale.  Something the size of the Colorado would be a thin line, and only one as vast as the Mississippi would be notable. The Judge should assume that any settlement or stronghold is likely near a river or sufficient body of water.  They should thoughtfully place any major rivers, flowing from highlands to wetlands or the coast.
Roads:  Much like rivers, only the most major of highways would be marked on such a map.  The Judge should be free to presume that any settlements or strongholds have roads or paths connecting them, barring some obstacle such as hills, mountains, or monster infested lands.

Strongholds
A Stronghold is a special kind of settlement, typically established by high level NPCs.  It can be a Warrior’s Keep, a Wizard’s Tower, an Outlaw’s Hideout, etc.  Like Towns, they secure they Hex in which they are located.  A stronghold is defined by its occupant(s), which are generated using the rules for NPCs of level 9+1d6 (or use the quick list below)

Thief 10: S 11  D 18 C 10  I 11  W 12 X 12; HP 41; Backstab x4; Leather +1, Sword +2, Ring of Protection

    • Thieves: On a d6, 1-3 is a Human, 4 is a Dwarf, 5 is a Halfling, and 6 is an Elf (Wizard level of 1d6)
    • Alignment: 1 (Lawful), 3-5 (Neutral), 6 (Chaotic-Hidden)
    • Strongholds will also have an apprentice, or guardian beast, of EHD equal to ½ the owner’s level.
    • Strongholds will be protected by 3d6x10 1HD warriors, half outfitted with Crossbows and Light Armor, and the rest with Heavy Armor and Polearms.  For every 30 soldiers there is also a sergeant of 4th level
Wilderness Encounters
The process for stocking wilderness is similar to that of the dungeon.  You can create a single table for the whole region or have a table for the forest, one for the hills, etc.  

First, determine the threat rank of the area.  You can presume that any “settled” hex (one that is secured or controlled) and those adjacent are equivalent to “level 1” of a dungeon.  For each hex beyond that, increase the level.  For areas that cover multiple hexes, you can take the lowest or the average value since the threat rank tables have overlap built in (the wilderness in unpredictable!).

To determine the nature of the encounter, first roll a d6 and consult the result against the number of hexes from civilization.  This will give you the “Threat” rank (I – VI) of the creature.

Next, determine the type of creature encountered.  This is done with a d6 as shown below:
	1: Animal Type		2-3: Humanoid Type	4-6: Monster Type

Finally, once you know the general category of creature and the (Equivalent) Hit Die range, select or otherwise determine the one you wish to use (see appendix A or Vol II), adding it to your encounter table, taking care to note the “number appearing” and “percent in lair” values.

You will repeat the process until you have a filled out encounter chart (typically 6 entries to start).  You may wish to pick creatures along a theme, allowing that first determination to set the tone for the region.  You may also want to reserve one entry for pitfalls, man-traps, or other tricks/phenomena. 

Number Appearing and % in Lair
When stocking a wilderness, use the number appearing and guidelines in volume 2 or in OED Monster Database.  The numbers of creatures in the wilds are not constrained by the limits of dungeon corridors.  
The “% in lair” statistic is rolled when the encounter comes up.  This will indicate that the party has encountered the lair of such creatures (camp, hut, cave, etc.)  Note on the map for future development.

Adjustment and Final Touches
As with designing a dungeon, you should feel free to ignore, reroll, or just change anything along the way that does not fit, or to make room for a better idea.  Want a forest near your dungeon?  Just add it.
Want your Stronghold ruled by an Elf Lord, Orc Bandit King, Vampire Queen, etc?. The sky is the limit.

Hex Paper:  If you don’t have hex paper you can use squares/graph paper.  Assume a 5mi square with a 7 mile diagonal, “averaging out” to 6 miles; allowing you to use these procedures (give or take).

Anything else of note about the area or its politics


Wilderness Exploration
Trips to explore or travel through the wilderness can be abstracted using the below procedures.

Movement
Movement across the wilderness is measured in move points per day.  A typical creature has 3 movement points, double for flying creatures.  For other creature types, divide their movement rate in feet by 20 (or movement in table inches by 4).  Groups of 100+ suffer a -1 penalty; groups of 1000+ a -2 penalty to their base move points (to a minimum of 1). This abstraction assumes daylight travel, along with occasional breaks, foraging, investigation, and trailblazing.

Terrain Difficulty
Each terrain type has a difficulty factor associated with it, this value represents the number of movement points needed to cross the terrain type, the chance (in 6) of an encounter, and the chance
(in 6) of getting lost. 

Terrain Type		Difficulty Factor
Dry				2
Forest				2
Hill (Mountain*)		3
Plains				1
Wetland			3

Modifiers
    • Any major river, ravine, or other obstacle will add +1 to the difficulty factor.
    • Traveling along a major road will subtract 1 from the difficulty factor (min 1).
    • *Mountain Hex: there is a 1 in 6 chance to make progress in a given day.
    • Night travel costs double (unless a full moon, on a clear night, in open terrain) and adds a +2 to the difficulty factor, even with Infravision. 


Procedure
Describe/Map: As the party explores beyond the bounds of the immediate area, the Judge should inform them of the new terrain type and features they encounter so they can learn and record the lay of the land on their map.

Encounter Check: Once per hex there is a chance in 6 for a random encounter equal to the terrain difficulty factor.  Encounter type is based on the tables you made earlier.  Parties outdoors have a chance to spot one another at a distance of 2d6x10 yards, using the same procedures as in a dungeon.

Evasion: The Judge may choose to roll morale for pursuing creatures if the party has fled their territory.

Lost Check:  A party navigating without reliable roads or consistently visible horizon markers has a chance in 6 to become lost equal to the terrain difficulty factor.  When the party becomes lost, the Judge rolls a 1d6 to determine which neighboring hex they end up in, with a 1 being their intended direction.


Weather
A tried and true way to determine the weather at any given time in game is to look out the window and use the prevailing conditions you see.  Or you can use the below table.
	
	d6	Weather Result and Effects
1-3	Clear: (Orcs, Goblins, etc. suffer daylight penalties)
4-6	Cloudy: (no modifiers)
6*	Precipitation: ½ Movement/Flight, -4 penalty to missile attacks, composite bows can 		not fire.  +1 chance to get lost. (* 1in6 chance to be Stormy: No ranged attacks, -1 to Morale)  Creatures must shelter or risk damage ????
		

For added variety, the Judge can opt to have a 1 in 6 chance of a change in weather to come through in at a given point in the day morning, afternoon, evening, or night.  This can also include warmer or colder than normal temperatures.

Exposure
Characters and creatures are presumed to be adequately dressed or acclimated to the weather (including armor, etc.).  If they are inappropriately garbed for the temperature (too hot or too cold) they take damage as below (the Judge may increment the damage for more extreme situations)
	Extreme Temperatures: Once you have gone 1 hour of exposure, you have a 50% chance 	each minute to suffer 1 point of damage (1d3 if exacerbating the situation).  You also suffer 	1d6 damage per hour and must also save vs death or suffer -1d6 Strength.

Night/Darkness
Creatures suffer the same penalties they do in darkness (movement, attack, morale); unless it is one of the nights of the full moon, with clear skies, and open terrain.

Resources 
The above rules assume groups are carrying food and water for their journey, supplemented with light foraging.  If a party runs out of resources, they suffer the effects below. 
	
	Lack of Water: Once you have gone 24 hours without water, you have a 50% chance each hour 	to suffer 1 point of damage (1d3 is engaging in strenuous activity).  You also suffer 1d6 damage 	per day without water and must also save vs death or suffer -1d6 Strength.

	Lack of Food: You have a 50% chance each day without food to suffer 1 point of damage (1d3 if 	engaging in strenuous activity).  You also suffer 1d6 damage per week without food and must 	also save vs death or suffer -1d6 Strength.







Longer Journeys
Perhaps you wish to abstract a long journey, instead of engaging in exploration.  For each 100 miles of travel, roll on the table below, modified by the Difficulty Factor of the worst terrain encountered on the route.  Allow the party to make decisions/take mitigating actions between each roll (effects are cumulative).  
	2d6	Outcome 
	3-4	Safe: Arrive 1 day early, no ill effects
	5-7	Safe: Arrive on time, no ill effects
	8	Delayed: Arrive 1d3 days behind
	7	Costly:  Each traveler loses d6x 10 x Hit Die sp
	8-13	Bloodied: Each traveler loses one-quarter total HP.
	14-15	Exposure: Each traveler loses one-half total HP. Save vs Death or lose 1d6 Strength.
	


Bases and Stongholds
PC can establish a base simply by putting down roots in a location.  Renting a house, buying an inn or a ship, establishing a business, or taking over a lair or hideout are all ways to set up a base.  This will give them a set location from which to operate.    

A Stronghold however is more than just a base of operations; it is a seat of power and authority.  When the time comes for a PC or party to establish their own stronghold, they must first secure and clear the area.  This will involve not only removing any foes in the area, but also laying claim to that area.  This can be done via a grant from a ruler or patron, other legal channels, or by securing a tract of wilderness.  

The below rules focus on a wilderness stronghold, but can be adapted to other situations such as a pirate ship, city thieves guild, wizard’s college, nomadic horde, druidic circle, etc.  They cover the basics of domain gameplay.  More detailed rules on economics, warfare, etc. are beyond the scope of this document. 

Construction
To construct a basic keep that is able to secure 1 hex worth of territory will cost 80,000 silver.  Such a Keep requires 282 weeks (5.4 years) to build.  One can increase the build cost up to 4 times (320,000sp), to reduce the build time by a proportional amount, in this case 1/4th (71 weeks).

For other structures, reference the prices found in Vol III or the historical price in shillings x3.  

They may also take over an established structure or and abandoned one, presume ½ the cost in repairs.   







Benefits
The benefits of establishing a stronghold begin to manifest as soon as construction begins as outlined below.

There are no longer random encounters / monster lairs within the Hex.

The PC no longer needs to replenish mundane items such as torches, rations, etc. prior to embarking on an adventure.   It is presumed “their people” take care of these tasks.

The area will being to attract settlers.  The Judge can assume that 3d6 families (averaging 5 people) settle in per season.  The standard stronghold can support and protect a community of up to 6500.

A Stronghold is protected by a compliment of 3d6x10 1HD warriors, half outfitted with Crossbows and Light Armor, and the rest with Heavy Armor and Polearms.  For every 30 soldiers there is also a sergeant of 4th level.  These forces begin to arrive in proportion to the completion of the construction.

The stronghold comes with an unerringly loyal “Major Domo” or similar NPC who manages the daily affairs, allowing the PC to continue adventuring.

It is recommended the PC spend at minimum 1 week in his Stronghold per season to maintain a good relationship with his folk, and thereby receive the above benefits.


Managing the Stronghold
For basic gameplay, the Judge can presume that such a Stronghold can sustain itself with regard to staffing, resources, and security under most circumstances.  If the PCs wish to explore the hiring of specialists or other economic actives, there is a list of specialists, siege weaponry, etc. in Volume III. 

For variety, the Judge can roll 2d6 on the table below once per season to determine special happenings

2d6	Outcome
2	Bane: Plague, Treachery, Revolt, War.
3-5 	Poor Season:  Attack (Monster, Bandit, Army), Poor Harvest, Depleted Resource(s) 
6-8	Uneventful Season (20% chance each for good or bad omen, +/-1 to next season’s roll)
9-11	Good Season: New Resource(s), Bountiful Harvest, Victory/Celebration,
12	Boon: Title of Nobility, Magic Item, Special Allies, etc.

Combat and Sieges
Armor Class: The structure by itself is a large, immobile target.  When Armor Class is called for, use 20.

HP/Damage:  Break structures into 20’ sections to adjudicate attacks.  Stone buildings and walls have 100 hp, while wooden ones have 30. When reduced to 0, that particular section of the structure is comprised (walls a breached, towers collapse, gates are opened, etc.)  The Judge is encouraged to use common sense about what sorts of attacks will inflict damage against a structure based on the attack type and building material(s). 

Supplies: When in doubt, assume a stronghold has enough resources to survive a siege for 2d6 months.

Siege Weapons and Attacks: When an attack roll is called for a siege weapon, use the attack bonus of the person manning the weapon (crew, captian, PC, etc.)  Presume a +0 to hit in most cases.

	Weapon		Cost (sp)	Rate of Attack	Damage		Range
	Ballista 		100  		1/3 rounds	2d6 		1500' 
	Battering Ram 	100		1/2 rounds	2d6 		0
	Catapult		200 		1/6 rounds	4d6 		500’ to 1000' 
	Trebuchet 	400 		1/10 rounds	6d6 		500’ to 1500' 

Ballista: This bolt thrower has a 180* firing arc at a range of 1500 feet (-1 to hit for every 100 feet). It inflicts 1d6 damage against a structure and creatures in a 10 foot line.  It can be fired once every 3 rounds and requires a crew of 4.

Battering Ram: This is a stout 10’ log, often capped with metal, used to bash against a door.  It weighs 400 pounds and requires 10 average strength creatures to operate.  The crew can charge once every other round.

Catapult: This weapon can hurl rocks, iron balls, or junk in a 90* arc to ranges between 500 and 1,000feet (-1 to hit for every 100 feet).   It inflicts 4d6 damage to a structure and creatures within a 10’ radius.  It can be fired once every 6 rounds and requires a crew of 6.

Trebuchet:  This large mechanical sling can hurl rocks, irons balls, or junk in a 90* arc to ranges between 500 and 1,500 feet (-1 to hit for every 100 feet).  It inflicts 6d6 damage to a structure and creatures within a 10’ radius.   It can be fired once per minute and requires a crew of 10.




















Nautical Adventuring
There are myriad factors to consider regarding watercraft and travel.  Presented below is a simplified approach to allow manageable adventures and combats at sea.

Types of Vessels
There are countless types of vessels across history for use in a game world.  Just as the various types of weapons and armor are abstracted down to a few types, vessels are presented by the types below.

Oared, Large:  Propelled primarily with multiple rows of oars, they are able to travel in the open water of inland seas; otherwise, they must hug the coasts.  They also possess a set of sails.  Ex: Trireme

Oared, Medium: Propelled primarily by a single large row of oars, they are built for speed.  They likewise typically only hug the coasts or island hop.  They also possess a sails. Ex: Dromon

Oared, Small: Propelled primarily by a single row of oars, they typically only hug the coasts or island hop.  They also possess a set of sails.  Ex: Longship

Sailed, Large: These multi-masted vessels are capable of safely traversing the open ocean between continents. However, they are unable to traverse all but the largest rivers. Ex, Galleon

Sailed, Medium: Possessing one or two masts, they are suitable for travel on inland seas or island hopping. Ex Caravel.

Sailed, Small: Single-masted, these vessels typically hug the coasts and traverse rivers. Ex Kogge.

Vessel			Distance (miles)	Tactical					Capacity/	Cost (sp) 
Type	Dimensions	per 12 hrs	Speed		Aboard			Weapons	Avg HP	
Oared 	 L 120’-160’; 	Oars 30		Oars*: 50’/rd 	20 Crew, 50 Warriors	150 tons/	30,000

See: Ancient Sailing | Ancient Ports - Ports Antiques (ancientportsantiques.com)  
Dimensions: This is the range of Keel length and Beam width that typifies this sort of vessel. 

Distance per 12 hours: This is the average amount of open water the vessel can traverse in a 12 hour “day”, it presumes that wind, water, and other factors average out.  The Judge may apply modifiers (+/- 30%) based on conditions (storm season, currents, shoals, crew status, captain skill, ship condition, etc.)
Note: Ships propelled by Oar can not travel at night as they must land in order to rest and feed the rowers.  Likewise, ships not in open water (rivers, shallows, or hugging coasts) may not travel at night.
Tactical Speed:  This is the base speed, per 10 second round, that the vessel can travel in combat or other tactical situations (See below)
*Oared Vessels can travel at double the listed speed for 10 minutes without exhausting the crew.  They can continue for up to another 10 minutes, but unable to travel by oar afterwards. 

Aboard: This is the standard deployment of operating personnel on the vessel, including weapon crews.

Capacity:  Once the space for crew, soldiers, weapons, and provisions is accounted, this is the amount of space available for additional cargo, goods, and passengers (1 passenger depletes 1 ton).  This is equal to the vessels cost divide by 100 in tons; half again for oared vessels.

Weapons: These are the locations of shipboard weapons in the standard build out.  The weapon, ammo, and crew are accounted for in the Cargo and Crew values. See below for weapon types.

Cost: The cost of the vessel, it does not cover the cost of a crew, provisions, ammunition, documents, etc.  Support Costs for Rowers is 1 SP per month, Crew cost 10 SP, Warriors are 2 SP (as men at arms).

Average Hit Points:  Ships have a number of hit points equal to their (keel) length plus (beam) width.

Ship to Ship Engagements
Once ships are in range of siege weapons (about 1,500 feet apart), combat and movement can begin to tracked in a manner similar to characters (or as forces per OED Book of War). 

Ship Characteristics
Armor Class:  Attacks against a ship itself by adjacent creatures are targeting a large, relatively immobile target.  When an Armor Class is called for, use AC 20.

HP/Damage:  The Judge is encouraged to use common sense about what sorts of attacks will inflict damage against a vessel.  When reduced to 0, the ship has sustained enough damage be dead in the water and will begin to sink.

Speed: During engagements, vessels use the tactical speed listed above, with modifications due to wind and weather (see below).   Oared Vessels can travel at double the listed speed for 10 minutes without exhausting the crew.  They can continue for up to another 10 minutes, but unable to travel by oar afterwards.

Turning: Oared vessels can turn 45* every 200’ traversed on a grid (60*/240’: if using hexes); Sailing vessels can turn 45* every 340’ traversed on a grid. (60*/440’: if using hexes)








Wind and Weather
When dealing with voyages (as above) we can average out the effect of wind, sea, and other factors. For ships maneuvering around one another for combat; we must know the conditions of the “battlefield”. 

Determine Weather and Wind
Determine the weather at the time of the engagement, followed by the wind strength.  

	d6	Weather (Wind)
1-3	Clear (d6; 1 = Calm, 2-5 = Light Breeze, 6 = Windy)
4-6	Cloudy (d6: 1-4 = Light Breeze, 5-6 = Windy) 
6*	Precipitation: 1 in 6 chance to be Stormy (d6: 1-2 = Breeze, 3-6 = Windy)
	Stormy (always Gale force winds)

Wind Adjustments to Sailing Speed
As mentioned above, vessels have a base speed for tactical movement.  Tactical sailing speed is modified by the direction of the wind, relative to the vessel’s prow as noted below.
    • In Calm winds, Vessels cannot move under sail power.
    • In a Light Breeze, sailing vessels speed is reduced by 25%
    • In Windy conditions sailings vessles speed is normal.
    • In a Gale, ships make no progress, they must hunker down and go where the winds/currents take them.  Galleys have 1 in 6 chance per hour to take on water.  If this happens 3 times, the ship begins to sink.   

Wind Directon and Sailing Speed 
Use a d8 to determine the cardinal direction of the wind 1 = North, working clockwise.  
    • Sailing in the same direction as the wind (within 45*): No special effect, use the listed speed.
    • Sailing perpendicular to the wind (within 45*): Reduce speed by 25%.
    • Sailing against the wind (within 45*): Reduce speed by 50%.
    • Oared speed is not impacted by wind direction.

Ship Weapons & Attacks
When an attack roll is called for a ship’s weapon, use the attack bonus of the person manning the weapon (crew, captian, PC, etc.)  Presume a +0 to hit in most cases.

Ballista: This bolt thrower has a 180* firing arc and a range of 1500 feet (-1 to hit for every 100 feet). It inflicts 2d6 damage against a ship and creatures in a 10 foot line.  It can fire once every 3 rounds and requires a crew of 4.

Catapult: This weapon can hurl rocks, iron balls, or junk in a 90* arc to ranges between 500 and 1,000feet (-1 to hit for every 100 feet).   It inflicts 4d6 damage to a ship and creatures within a 10’ radius.    It can be fired once every 6 rounds and requires a crew of 6.

Ramming: When one ship rams a target, the target will lose 10-60% of its maximum HP (1d6x10).  The ramming ship suffers damage equal to half this amount, unless is it outfitted with a ram.  Creatures aboard rammed ship must make a save vs stone or suffer 1d6 damage.  

Sheering Oars: Vessels with oars will have them sheared off when colliding with another vessel along the given side.  When this occurs, the vessel’s oared movement rate will be reduced by half.  Rowers on the given side will take 2d6 damage, save vs stone for half.  Sheering the remaining side will render the ship unable to move.

Boarding & Combat 
Barring the effect of the highest level spells, siege weapons, or other special abilities; combat between ship’s occupants can commence when they are within 100’ to 150’ feet of one another (common missile range). 

Grapple Lines:  Creatures on a ship can attempt to toss grapple lines in preparation to board a ship.  Treat tossing a grapple line as a thrown weapon attack against AC 9.  Defenders can cut or loosen a grapple with an appropriate attack or ability check.  Once 3 grapple points are in place, the target is considered grappled and the ship can be boarded.  Both ships are assumed to be un-moving once in a grapple

Crew vs Crew: Once ships are grappled or otherwise in contact, combat is resolved normally and character scale with appropriate checks and modifiers for cover, climbing, swimming, etc.  Ships can be captured when the morale of the crew or the captain fails.


Exploration and Encounters at Sea
As it has been previously suggested, a Judge should thoughtfully place large bodies of water (and mountains) as natural boundaries for campaigns.  It is likewise suggested that when a campaign turns to the open sea, that a Judge use consideration in placing new land masses (populating them as they would a Wilderness).

When traversing rivers and coasts, you can use the same encounter rules that you would for the prevailing terrain of the nearby land, particularly when making landfall.  By contrast, the open seas are vast, and as such, you should consider making a single encounter check per day and night.  These encounter tables can include standard aquatic monsters, great sea monsters, friendly and hostile vessels, and the occasional mysterious island!  
Keep in mind that on a clear open sea, parties may spot one another at a distances of near 12 miles.
