# Characters

## Ability Scores

Prior to the selection of character race and class, it is necessary to determine ability scores.

### Generation

Roll abilities, roll one selected ability 2d6+6, others 3d6 in order.

### Modifiers

In OED the modifiers from your ability scores affect the attributes listed below.

- *Strength*: Melee Attacks and Melee Damage
- *Intelligence*: Secret Door and Trap Detection
- *Wisdom*: Saves vs. Mental Attacks
- *Dexterity*: Missile Attacks and Armor Class
- *Constitution*: Hit Die Rolls
- *Charisma*: Reaction Rolls

|Score   |Modifier|
|--------|---|
|0-2     |-3 |
|3-5     |-2 |
|6-8     |-1 | 
|9-12    | 0 |
|13-15   |+1 |
|16-18   |+2 |
|19-21   |+3 |
|22-24   |+4 |
|Every 3 |(+1) |

**Experience Points**: In OED, ability scores do not affect XP earned. Elves and Dwarves earn 20% less XP than humans. This represents their conservative cultures and general inflexibility in relation to humans. Calculate the XP for all each party member at the end of an adventure as normal and then reduce by 20% the Elf or Dwarfs earned XP. ie. an Elf or Dwarf requires 100 sp to earn 80 xp.

## Languages

**Known Languages**: Characters start with Common and their own racial language (if nonhuman). They may specify other languages, as determeind by Intelligence bonus, at creation or later. The maximum number of extra languages learned is 1 per point of Intelligence above 10. We recommend defining a new one during any downtime between adventures. PCs with intelligence of at least 10 are literate in their native language and for each 2 points of intelligence thereafter are literate in 1 additional language. 

**Common**: Common represents the standard Human language of the region. 

**Alignment Languages** Alignment/divisional tongues are _not_ known automatically; they must be learned like any other language. Usually this is only done by agents, officers, or subjugated populations of specific powers. 

 
## Alignment

OED features 3 alignment options:

- *Lawful* beings want civilization peaceful and expanding; they take prisoners, pay taxes, obey the king.
- *Neutral* beings seek a balance, or are simply disinterested.
- *Chaotic* beings want civilization broken down and destroyed; the never take prisoners and stab each other in the back. PCs should list their alignment as either neutral or lawful and secretly inform the DM.

alignment is generally not a strict code of conduct and instead vaguely states a characters allegience to either human civilisation or monstrous polities.

## Race

**Movement**: In OED all PC races move at a base speed of 12" (60') per round.

### Humans

**Class Options**: Can be a member of any class, and advance to an unlimited level.

### Dwarves

**Special Abilities**: Resist Magic (+4 to Saves), Dodge Giants (+4 to AC), Stone Detection (+1 in 6 to detect Traps, Secret Doors, etc. in stonework).

**Experience Gain**: -20%. Dwarves earn experience points at a slower rate than humans. This compensates for thier increased abilities and also represents their stubborness and conservatism slowing down their ability to learn new things.

### Elves

**Special Abilities**: Hide in Woods (4 in 6), Woodland Detection (+1 in 6 to detect Traps, Secret Doors, etc. in woodlands).

**Experience Gain**: -20%. Elves earn experience points at a slower rate than humans. This compensates for thier increased abilities and also represents their haughtiness and conservatism impeding their ability to learn new things.

### Halflings

**Special Abilities**: Hide in Woods (4 in 6), Resist Magic (+4 to Saves), Ranged Attacks +4, Can use Light melee Weapons or use Medium melee weapons two handed, plus sling, shortbow, and light crossbow.

**Ability Scores**: Strength Capped at 8. If a higher score is rolled it is discarded and replaced with 8.

**Hit Points**: Halflings always use a d4 for hit points regardless of their class.

## Class

OED features three character classes: Fighter, Thief, and Wizard. There are no Clerics in OED.

**Starting Hit Points**: When determining HP at first level, reroll 1s and 2s.

### Fighters

**Spell Casting**: "Vancian" magic; 

**Spellbook**: Wizards start with a spellbook containing the *read magic* spell and one additional 1st level spell which can be chosen by the player during character creation. Each level of spells requires its own book. Replacement or duplicate spellbooks require time and expense the same as learning spells.

**Learning Spells**: Adding a new spell from a book or scroll requires a roll of d20 + Wizard Level + Int modifier ≥ 20. Requires 1 day per spell level.

**Spell Research**: Requires 1 week per spell level and a roll of *(d20 - spell level + Wizard Level + Int Modifier ≥ 20)*. Access to a library or other resources grant a +4 to the roll.

**Magic Item Creation**: Takes 1 day and 100SP per spell level/charge/use and the ability to cast the relevant spell(s). 

The DM will secretly roll a 1 in 20 chance for a mishap/cursed item.

*Note*: Treat potions of healing as a 1st level spell, and Mithridate as 4th level spell.

### Multi Classing

**Adding Classes**: A character must have a 16 or greater in the Prime Requisite of the new class (Strength for Fighter, Dexterity for Thieves, Intelligence for Wizards), and must pay 1000xp to add the new class. 

**Experience Points**: After each adventure, the character applies all earned XP to a single class of their choice.

**Benefits of Multiclassing**:

-   Uses best entry for Armor.
-   Uses best entry for Weapons.
-   Uses best value for Attacks
-   Uses highest class for Saves,
-   Keep a separate HP tally for each class and use the higher of the two for your character's HP.
-   Fighter/Wizards may cast spells in Light (Leather) and Medium (Chain) armor as long as they do not employ a shield.
-   Fighter/Wizards may cast spells so long as they only wield 1 handed melee weapon, and have a free hand.
-   Thief skills can only be used in Light (Leather) armor.
-   Only first level Wizards start with spells known. A character multiclassing into Wizard must learn spells from scrolls or found spellbooks.
