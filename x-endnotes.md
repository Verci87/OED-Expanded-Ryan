## Fighter Feat Sources

The motivation for the Fighter Feats system is to replicate various benefits accrued to Fighters over the evolution of the O/AD&D game system. It may be of interest to note the source of inspiration for the feats we've selected, given below. Note that we don't attempt to match the exact mechanics in those sources; we've carefully balanced the effects in the context of our OD&D-based system.

| Feat                  | Inspiration                                               |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Berserking            | Berserkers in Vol-2, Sup-IV (Odin), Dragon #3.            |
| Exceptional Strength  | Fighter strength percentile in Greyhawk/AD&D PHB.         |
| Great Fortitude       | Paladin immunity to disease in Greyhawk/AD&D PHB.         |
| Iron Will             | Cavalier resistance to mental attacks in AD&D UA.         |
| Mounted Combat        | Cavalier mounted combat bonuses in AD&D UA.               |
| Rapid Shot            | Bow double attacks in Chainmail/AD&D PHB.                 |
| Rapid Strike          | Fighter multiple attacks in AD&D PHB.                     |
| Survival              | Barbarian survival skill in AD&D UA.                      |
| Toughness             | Barbarian increased hit points in AD&D UA.                |
| Tracking              | Ranger tracking in TSR #2/AD&D PHB/UA.                    |
| Two Weapon Fighting   | Two weapon option in AD&D DMG (parry from Chainmail).     |
| Weapon Specialization | Fighter weapon specialization in AD&D UA.                 |

Put another way, the various O/AD&D fighter subclasses can be approximated by selection of various feats (or, of course, the player can flexibly mix-and-match to taste). The following are suggested as the first three feats for each subclass (to 12th level):

| Subclass        | Feat Selections                                           |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Fighter (basic) | Exceptional strength, weapon specialization, rapid strike |
| Barbarian       | Berserking, toughness, survival                           |
| Cavalier        | Mounted combat, weapon specialization, iron will          |
| Paladin         | Great fortitude, iron will, rapid strike                  |
| Ranger          | Tracking, survival, two-weapon fighting                   |
