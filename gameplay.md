# Gameplay

The core mechanic of OED is the Target 20 roll as summarized below. Some
game actions are resolved on an X in 6 chance using a d6 (see
Adventuring).

**Melee Attacks**: d20 + Attack Bonus + Str Modifier + Target AC ≥ 20

**Ranged Attacks**: d20 + Attack Bonus + Dex Modifier + Target AC ≥ 20

**Saving Throws**: d20 + Level + Save Mod ≥ 20

|Save Type|Save Mod|
|:---|:---:|
|Spells    |    +0|
|Breath    |    +1|
|Stone      |   +2|
|Wands      |   +3|
|Death      |   +4|

**Ability Checks**: d20 + Level + Modifier ≥ 20.

**Thief Skills**: d20 + Thief Level + Dex Modifier ≥ 20.

**Learn/Research Spell**: d20 + Wizard Level + Int Modifier ≥ 20.

## Adventuring

### Scale, Movement, and Time

**Scale**: OED uses the below scale for dungeon combat. For battlefield
scale see [Book of War](http://www.lulu.com/content/paperback-book/original-edition-delta-book-of-war/11207461).

|Unit |Scale|
|:---|:---|
|1 round     |  6 seconds |
|1 turn      |  1 minute |
|1" on table |  5 feet or 1 "pace" or 2 Yards|

**Movement**: All player races move at a base rate of 30' per round, equivalent to a brisk walk. A jog is double this (60'). A run is triple (120'), sustainable for a 1 Con + *Bonus* minutes.

**Time**: ~~Assume that the amount of time spent searching and exploring is analogous to actual time spent. This will result in checking for wandering monsters every 15 minutes of real time, adding a check for long searches (such as for secret doors, etc.).~~ Use 10 minute dungeon turns B/X style. Most activities require 10 minutes such as searching a room, recovering after a combat and looting the bodies, listening at a door.


### Light and Vision

**Lighting**: Torches and lanterns shed good light out to 30', and dim
light out to 60'. In dim light one can make out basic shapes and/or
glowing eyes.

**Infravision**: Infravision allows one to see (most) creatures in
darkness clearly out to 1/2 the specified distance (30') and dimly out to
the full listed distance (60'). It is spoiled when looking directly at a
torch/fire source.

**Darkness/Blindness**: Creatures unable to see suffer a –4 penalty to AC and melee attacks. They cannot make ranged attacks (see errant shots below), move at half speed, and suffer –1 to morale.

### Adventuring Tasks

In OED a number of tasks are resolved with a d6 roll. The chance for success is listed as X in 6, and can be modified a number of "pips" (numbers) up or down by circumstance or race/class ability.

|Task|        Chance   |Modifiers/Notes|
|:----------- |:--------:| :----------------------------------------------------|
|Climbing    |2 in 6   |\+ Dexterity *Bonus*; - Encumbrance Level (0-3); +2 for using a rope.|
|Detection   |2 in 6   |\+ Intelligence *Bonus*|
|Doff Armor  |3 in 6   |Chance per round, Leather and Chain Only|
|Force a Door|2 in 6   |\+ Strength *Bonus*: Locks/Bars -2, Reinforced Gates -4, Solid Metal -6|
|Swimming    |2 in 6\* |\+ Strength *Bonus*; -# of Stone carried; +/-1 for water conditions|
|Tracking    |4 in 6\**|+/- 1 small or large parties, inclement weather, and the like|

\* Fighters and Thieves gain a +2 as noted in their class description,
for a base 4 in 6 chance.

\*\* Fighters with the Tracking feat only

**Climbing**: When climbing you move at half speed on a successful
check. A failed check is stalled movement. If you fail the roll by 2
pips or greater you fall.

**Climbing with Rope**: Grants a +2 to the roll and allows one to move
downward at up to 4x speed. A sharp jolt while on the rope results in a
1 in 20 chance for the rope to break.

**Hauling with Rope**: A character can haul a load safely up or down a
rope equal to their Strength score in Stone. A sharp jolt while on the
rope results in a 1 in 20 chance for the rope to break.

**Detection**: Used to find a secret door, listen at a door, discover a
trap, etc. Listening can not be done while wearing a helmet.

**Doff Armor**: It takes 1 round (each) to remove a shield, helm, or
backpack. Leather and Chain armor have a 2 in 6 chance per round. Plate
requires 3 turns to remove with assistance.

**Force a Door**: Limited to one character per door panel. Special tools
(ropes, ram, etc.) will allow the summation of all character's Strength
modifiers.

**Jumping**: A running jump will allow a man sized creature to cover a distance of d6×3 feet, + Strength *Bonus*, - encumbrance level. Half again for a long jump, half again for a vertical jump.

**Swimming**: When swimming you move at half speed on a successful
check. A failed check is stalled movement. If you fail the roll by 2
pips or greater you sink (see Drowning/Suffocation). You may swim at
full speed with a -2 to the check.

### Hazards
In general, all spells and harmful effects should require an attack or
allow some form of saving throw to either negate the effect or result in
half effect/damage.

**Diseases**: When exposed to a disease hazard, a Save vs Breath will
avoid Strength damage for the day. Recovery requires bed rest.

- *Rat Plague*: –1d12 Strength per day. Recover 3 Strength per week of rest.
- *Tick Fever*: –1d6 Strength per week. Recover 1 Strength per week of rest.
- *Leech Fever*: –1 Strength per day. Recover 3 Strength per week of rest.
- *Mummy Rot*: –1 Strength per day. Recovery (See Magic Diseases below).

**Magic Diseases**: Magical disease such as Lycanthropy and Mummy Rot
can be removed via the Remove Curse spell in place of the Remove Disease
spell.

**Drowning/Suffocation**: You have a 50% chance each round without air
to suffer 1 point of damage (1d3 if surprised). You also suffer 1d6
damage per Turn (minute) without air. Damage is doubled if surprised.

**Falling**: Suffer 1d6 damage per 10 feet fallen (Max 50d6). A
successful Save vs Stone halves the damage. Damage may be modified by 1
or 2 pips per die based on landing surface.

**Level Drain**: Characters are allowed a Save vs Death to avoid Level
Drain effect. If the save is failed, XP is set to the midpoint of the
prior level. Current and Max HP are reduced proportionally (divide by
original level), possibly resulting in death at 0hp. The number of lost
HP should be noted and returned if/when the level is re-achieved.

**Poison**: Unless otherwise specified, a failed save vs poison means
incapacitation, then death in 1d6 rounds. Normal animals may have
delayed or non-fatal effect (HP damage, Incapacitation, etc.)

## Combat

**Surprise**: Parties are surprised on a roll of 2 in 6. If the foes are
unseen (hidden, invisible, elven cloak, etc.) the chance is increased by
2 pips. If the foes are silent (motionless, undead, moving silently,
etc.) the chance is increased by 2 pips. A warning (the presence of
light, noisy action, magic detection, etc.) negates the surprise roll. A
party with the advantage of surprise gets a free round of action before
initiative is rolled.

**Initiative**: Roll a d6 per side; high rolling side goes first; ties
go to players. Players declare and resolve actions around the table in
order.

**Actions**: On their turn, characters can move and then take an action,
in that order. The following actions *disallow* movement during that
round:

-   Casting a Spell
-   Set a Pike
-   Retrieve a Scroll
-   Use a Retrieved Scroll
-   Retrieve and Use a Potion
-   Ranged Attacks (unless a weapon thrown in the same direction as the
    character's movement)

**Fleeing**: A creature can flee combat and does not draw a free attack
at its back, but does suffer the penalty for attacks to the rear.

**Withdraw**: In combat a creature can move up to half their speed
without turning their back on the enemy, preventing an attack against
the rear flank.

**Critical Hits**: In most cases, a natural 1 is an automatic miss, 
and 20 an automatic hit (DM rules on impossible cases). 
The former may give a chance for a fumble; the latter does double damage 
(roll twice with bonuses).

**Combat Modifiers**: The following situational modifiers may be added
to attack rolls.

-   Attacks to the target's rear: +2 to hit & To hit roll ignores shield
    AC.
-   Target does not have a weapon drawn: +4 to hit in melee.    
-   Attacker is silent or unseen: +4 to hit.
-   Target is stunned, stationary: +4 to hit.
-   Target is helpless: +6 to Ranged attacks; Automatic Melee attacks for
    full damage.

**Shots at Groups**: When firing at a specific individual in a crowd, if
the attack roll (d20 + To Hit + Dex Modifier + Range/Attack Modifiers; but
*not* AC) is less than 10, it misses the (man-size) target.

**Errant Shots**: Ranged attack rolls (as above) below 10 miss the target, 
but may hit another nearby (determined randomly). Errant, fumbled, or random attacks into groups 
are assessed with a raw d20 roll that ignores attacker skill and range modifiers.

**Grappling**: Instead of attacking you may attempt to Grapple. Grapple is a kind of unarmed attack and goes last, after all normal weapon attacks.

| size  | Mod |
| --- | ---: |
| small | -5 | 
| medium  | 0 |
| large | +5 |
| larger | +5 each |

*Grapple Attack PC*: (d20 + size + To Hit + Str Mod). 

*Grapple Attack NPC*: (d20 + size + HD + 1/2HD). 

*Grapple Defence PC*: (10 + size + To Hit + Str Mod).  

*Grapple Defence NPC*: (10 + size + HD + 1/2HD). 

 Roll a Grapple Attack VS opponents Grapple Defence. If attacker took damage from melee they minus the damage amount from their roll. If the attacker wins the check they make the defender immobile and can do one of the following:
 
- make a normal attack with a weapon. Anything longer than a dagger is disadvantaged.
- make an additional opposed Grapple check to throw the enemy to the ground prone. You can choose to let go or go prone with them to retain grapple.
- drag the enemy with you on your next move if they dont break free

The target must win a Grapple check on their turn to break free. The target can choose instead to simply attack the grappler, any weapon other than a dagger is at disadvantage. 

**Subdual Attacks**: Blunt, wooden weapons can optionally be used to attack for nonlethal damage.  If the attack reduces the target to 0 Hit Points, it is knocked out.  Damage from critical hits becomes lethal, regardless of attacker's intent.

### Death and Healing

**Zero Hit Points**: When a character reaches or goes below 0 Hit
Points, they must immediately make a Save vs Death. Failure means the
character is Dead. Success results in the character stabilizing at 0HP,
waking in 1d6 turns, in an incapacitated state. The character must roll on the lingering injury table.
Any healing (returning the character to 1 HP) will restore normal activity.

**Natural Healing**: Creatures regain 1 hit point per full day of rest outside of a safe town (eg. while in the wilderness or dungeon).

Creatures regain a number of Hit Points equal to Level (Hit Dice) + Con *Bonus* per full day of rest and comfort in a safe town. The creature can not undergo other meaningful activities.

Creatures regain a number of Hit Points equal to (2 x Level (Hit Dice) + Con *Bonus*) per full day of rest and comfort in a hospital (mostly found at temples of religious orders dedicated to gods of healing). The creature can not undergo other meaningful activities.

**Magical Healing**: The only common source of magical healing in OED
are potions of healing and potions of mithridate (neutralize poison)
which are available from Wizards and NPC Alchemists. There is no common
source of regeneration, resurrection, or restoration magic.

Priests and some wizards do have healing magic but all priestly magic has a cost, even simple healing spells. Resurrection, restoration and regeneration magic is extremely costly, requires rare components and often requires sacrifice.

**Character Death**: Players can take control of a retainer or henchman for the remainder of the session.

- Spells generally need line-of-sight to their target point.
- All spells permit saving throws for anyone directly or negatively affected by them (half effect for damage type spells). 
- Concentration (when required) permits ½ speed movement, but no attacks, spells, or taking damage.
- “Man-size” creatures are those of 1 HD (base, without class levels).
- Low-level detection spells (up to 3rd level) are generally blocked by 3 feet of dirt or wood, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of metal, or a thin sheet of lead. Higher-level spells are blocked only by special protections.


### Cleric Spells

Clerics are not present as a class in OED but priests, religious orders and esotericists abound. Most magic in the world is done by Priests in a highly regulated fashion; Wizards are generally rare and considered unregulated and dangerous if rarely illegal.

The Cleric spells still exist in the game but are treated like arcane spells in terms of the way they are learned and cast with the exception that by default they require powdered silver to cast of an amount costing (spell level x spell level x 50 silver)
